## Project Queries

- Right now when we go to projects the params don't show which department's project we are checking out. Same way, if go to any product then in params we don't see which department and then which project is this product is and we can't see that.
  If we want to show that then probably we will have to update the routed and thier structuring. We will have to nest projects in deparments and products in projects. Need to discuss and rethink on this.
